ONSET <- c(1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,
           1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
           0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,
           1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,

mydata <- data.frame(ID,HIAA,TRYPT,as.factor(ONSET))
str(mydata)
head(mydata)
```

## Question 1

```{r}
pairs(~HIAA + TRYPT + ONSET, data = mydata,
      main = "Scatterplot Matrix")
```

## Question 2

```{r}
mydata.GLM <- glm(ONSET ~ HIAA + TRYPT, 
                  data = mydata, 
                  family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(mydata.GLM)
```

The logistic regression equation: $logit(ONSET) = 2.1 - 0.01 \times HIAA + 5.055*10^{-6} \times TRYPT$

## Question 3

```{r}
exp(mydata.GLM$coefficients)
```

The odds ratio for HIAA is 0.987. ONSET = 0 (late onset of excessive alcohol consumption) is the reference category. For every increased unit of HIAA, the odds of a 1 (early) ONSET compared to a 0 (late) ONSET decreases by $(1-0.987) \times 100% = 1.3%$ after holding TRYPT constant.

The odds ratio for TRYPT is 1.000. For every increased unit of TRYPT, the odds of a 1 (early) ONSET compared to a 0 (late) ONSET increases very little (near to 0) after holding HIAA constant.

## Question 4

```{r}
exp(confint(mydata.GLM,level = 0.95))
```


| Variable | Odds Ratio (95% CI) | p-value |
|:---------|--------------------:|--------:|
| 5AIHH | 0.987 (0.976, 0.997) | 0.0153 |
| TRYPT | 1.000 (1.000, 1.001) | 0.9827 |

## Question 5

```{r}
mydata$HAT <- hatvalues(mydata.GLM)
HAT.CUT <- 2*(2+1)/length(ID)
plot(HAT ~ ID, data = mydata,
     ylab = "Leverage",
     xlab = "ID Number",
     main = "Leverage by Index Plot")
abline(h = HAT.CUT, col = "red")

mydata[mydata$HAT > HAT.CUT,]
```

The result shows that 9 observations are high-leverage points.  They are outliers occuring in the independent variable space.

## Question 6

```{r}
mydata$COOK <- cooks.distance(mydata.GLM)
COOK.CUT <- 4/length(ID)
plot(COOK ~ ID, data = mydata,
     ylab = "Cook's Distance",
     xlab = "ID Number",
     main = "Cook's Distance by Index Plot")
abline(h = COOK.CUT, col = "red")

mydata[mydata$COOK > COOK.CUT,]
```

There are 7 observations with high Cook's distance values. They are outliers.


## Question 7

```{r}
if(!require(LogisticDx)){install.packages("LogisticDx")}
library("LogisticDx")
gof(mydata.GLM,plotROC = FALSE, g = 9)
```

From the result of Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-squared test, p-value is 0.399. As this tests the null hypothesis that the model is a poor fit for the data, p-value is large enough that we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance. Therefore, we conclude that the model is poorly fitted.


```{r}
if(!require(rms)){install.packages("rms")}
library("rms")
mydata.GLM.DX <- lrm(ONSET ~ HIAA + TRYPT)
mydata.GLM.DX
```

The Nagelkirke's $R^2$ is 0.069. The model explains about 6.9% of the variability in CDA classification.
