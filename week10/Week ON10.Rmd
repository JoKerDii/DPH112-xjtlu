# Review of previous learning
We have now completed our extension of our understanding of simple linear regression models 

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1$

onto multiple linear regression models

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_p X_p = \beta_0 + \sum{\beta_p X_p}$

The process of development of models under both cases is the same -- you build the model and then you test it. Before we move on to different sort of model kinds of models, I want to discuss three very important topics that are easily demonstrated using our current learning.

## Example 1A
In this lesson, we will use data from a random sample of 100 births from the North Carolina Birth Registry. The birth weight (BW) in grams of 100 babies were recorded, as was the length of the pregnancy in weeks (WK). For the purposes of our example, BW is the dependent variable.

str(NCREG)
head(NCREG)
plot(y = NCREG$BW, x = NCREG$WK,
     ylab = "Birth Weight (grams)",
     xlab = "Length of Gestation (weeks)",
     main = "Random Sample of Births from the North Carolina Birth Registry")
```

I will mark out the mean value of the independent variable using a red vertical line.

```{r}
plot(y = NCREG$BW, x = NCREG$WK,
     ylab = "Birth Weight (grams)",
     xlab = "Length of Gestation (weeks)",
     main = "Random Sample of Births from the North Carolina Birth Registry")
abline(v = 38.36, col = "red")
```



On regressing BW on WK, we derive the following results:

```{r}
NCREG.LM1 <- lm(BW ~ WK, data = NCREG)
summary(NCREG.LM1)
```

The estimated equation is $BW = -1732.1 + 129.1 WK$.

# Centring Data
We learned that the interpretation of the intercept parameter is often quite problematic depending on the scope of the independent variable. This is the case here. The formal interpretation of $b_0 = -1732.1$ is that if the duration of pregnancy is zero weeks, we would expect the birthweight to be -1,732.1 grams. A negative weight is, of course, impossible. However, even if the estimate was positive, it would be very hard for us to believe this because the value of the independent variable is out of scope.

There is an easy soluton to this problem. We can adjust the independent variable by subtracting the mean of all observation from each observation: $x_{ci} = x_i - \bar{x}$. This new variable is centred with a mean of zero, but with the same standard deviation as the original data. If we use this centred variable in the regression, we get the following result:

```{r}
NCREG$WK.CEN <- NCREG$WK - mean(NCREG$WK)
NCREG.LM2 <- lm(BW ~ WK.CEN, data = NCREG)
summary(NCREG.LM2)
```

The estimated equation now becomes $BW = 3220.3 + 129.1 WK.CEN$. While we have retained the same estimate $b_1$ across both models, the intercepts have changed substantially. How, then, do we interpret this information. Perhaps the centred scatterplot will give us a clue. 

```{r}
plot(y = NCREG$BW, x = NCREG$WK.CEN,
     ylab = "Birth Weight (grams)",
     xlab = "Length of Gestation (weeks) (centred)",
     main = "Random Sample of Births from the North Carolina Birth Registry")
abline(v = 0, col = "red")
```

When we centre an independent variable, the zero point is now the mean of the distribution. This is seen clearly in the scatterplot above. While the formal interpretation of the intercept does not change -- it is the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero -- the meaning of the zero point is now quite meaningful. Thus, for the results shown above, the estimated birthweight is 3220.3 grams during the mean length of gestation of 38.4 weeks. The interpretation of the slope parameter has not changed: for every week that the pregnancy progresses, the birthweight increases by 129.1 grams.

# Scaling Data
Centring only brings us so far. Note what happens when we change the unit of the independent variable. For example, instead of weeks, we are interested in the daily change in birthweight.

```{r}
NCREG$DAY.CEN <- NCREG$WK.CEN * 7
NCREG.LM3 <- lm(BW ~ DAY.CEN, data = NCREG)
summary(NCREG.LM3)
```

The slope estimate has changed because we changed the unit of the independent variable. We encountered this problem when we discussed the covariance. The solution we used was to standardise the data so that they become unitless. In the case of covariance, the resulting standardised measure was called the correlation.

We can do the same here. In effect, we wish to produce an independent variable that is *unitless*. To do this, we can scale a centred variable by dividing by the estimate of the standard deviation $s_x$. 

```{r}
NCREG$WK.STD <- NCREG$WK.CEN/sd(NCREG$WK.CEN)
plot(y = NCREG$BW, x = NCREG$WK.STD,
     ylab = "Birth Weight (grams)",
     xlab = "Length of Gestation (standardised)",
     main = "Random Sample of Births from the North Carolina Birth Registry")
abline(v = 0, col = "red")
```

IMPORTANT: Remember that a centred and scaled variable is called a standardised variable.

The estimated linear model is

```{r}
NCREG.LM4 <- lm(BW ~ WK.STD, data = NCREG)
summary(NCREG.LM4)
```

How do we interpret the slope parameter for standardised independent variables? Very easy. Applying the usual interpretation, we state that for every unit increase in the length of gestation, the birthweight increases by 433.3 grams. There is no difference in our formal of interpretation, although the meaning changes. Remember that a standardised variable has mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Therefore, a unit increase means that the independent variable increases by 1 standard deviation. Another way to interpret this is to say that an increase of one standard deviation in the length of gestation increases birthweight by 433.3 grams.

What is the value of a single standard deviation?

```{r}
sd(NCREG$WK.CEN)
```

Centring, scaling and standardising can be performed on the dependent variable, too. Some famous examples of standardised variables in health and medicine include bone minreal density, anthropometric data and IQ. Sometimes, standardised vaiables are called *z-scores*.

# Qualitative Independent Variables
So far, we have considered only independent variables that have been *continuous scaled* that have yielded numerical values that were measurements in the usual sense of the word. Frequently, however, it is desirable to use one or more qualitative variables as independent variables in the regression model. Qualitative variables, it will be recalled, are those variables whose "values" are categories and that convey the concept of attribute rather than amount or quantity. Another name for qualitative variables are nominal or categorical varaibles. The variable marital status, for example, is a qualitative variable whose categories are "single," "married," "widowed," and "divorced." Other examples of qualitative variables include sex (male or female), diagnosis, race, occupation, and immunity status to some disease.

IMPORTANT: In R, qualitative variables are *factor* variables.

In order to incorporate a qualitative independent variable ina regression model, it must be quantified in some manner. This may be accomplished through the use of what are known as *dummy variables*. A dummy variable is a variable that assumes only a finite number of values (such as 0 or 1) for the purpose of identifying the different categories of a qualitative variable.

The term "dummy" is used to indicate the fact that the numerical values (such as 0 and 1) assumed by the variable have no quantitative meaning but are used merely to identify different categories of the qualitative variable under consideration. Qualitative variables are sometimes called indicator variables, and when there are only two categories, they are sometimes called *dichotomous* or *binary* variables.

IMPORTANT: Technically, any numerical values can be used. For example, to indicate the two categories of sex, you can set "males" to be 56 and "females" to be $sin(\sqrt{30}-\pi)$. Doing this comes at the cost of complicating the interpretation of the results. For the remainder of this module, we will specify codes that are zero and one. For example, "males" is one and "females" is zero.

Where the qualitative variable has $k$ categories, $k-1$ dummy variables must be defined for all the categories to be properly coded. The variable sex, with two categories, can be quantified by the use of only one dummy variable. 

**Table 2. Dummy coding for sex.**

| Level of sex | Variable X1 |
|:-------------|:-----------:|
| Male         | 1           |
| Female       | 0           |

Note how all levels of the variable are defined by a single dummy variable. To specify that an observation is male, then $x_1 = 1$. To specify that an observation is female, then $x_1 = 0$ 

If your variable has four levels, then you require three  dummy variables. For example, take the variable `location of house` which may have four categories -- Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Other Jiangsu.

**Table 3. Dummy coding for location of house**

| Level of variable | Variable X1 | Variable X2 | Variable X3 |
|:------------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:| 
| Suzhou            | 1           | 0           | 0           |
| Nanjing           | 0           | 1           | 0           |
| Wuxi              | 0           | 0           | 1           |
| Other Jiangsu     | 0           | 0           | 0           |

To specify that someone's house is in Suzhou, will mean that $x_1 = 1; x_2 = 0; x_3 = 0$. Someone with a house in Nanjing will have this pattern: $x_1 = 0; x_2 = 1; x_3 = 0$. Someone with a houses in Wujiang will have this pattern: $x_1 = 0; x_2 = 0; x_3 = 0$.

Let us use an example.

## Example 1B
The data I gave in Example 1A was incomplete. In fact, we have access to a second independent variable -- the smoking status of the mother (SM). The smoking status is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker and 0 if the mother is a non-smoker.

**Table 4. Data from a simple random sample of 100 births from the North Carolina Birth Registry.**

str(NCREG2)
head(NCREG2)
```

Note that `SM` appears in R as a numeric variable. We need to convert it into a factor variable.

```{r}
NCREG2$SM.F <- factor(NCREG2$SM, 
                      levels = c(0,1), 
                      labels = c("Non-smoker", "Smoker"))
str(NCREG2)
head(NCREG2)
```

With this extra information, our scatterplot will change considerably.

```{r}
with(NCREG2, plot(WK, BW, col = SM.F,
                  ylab = "Birth Weight (grams)",
                  xlab = "Length of Gestation (weeks)", 
                  main = "Random Sample of Births from the North Carolina Birth Registry"))
```

The black circles are mothers who are non-smokers and the red ones are mothers who are smokers.

Let us fit the regression model.

```{r}
NCREG2.LM1 <- lm(BW ~ WK + SM.F, data = NCREG2)
summary(NCREG2.LM1)
```

The estimated equation is $BW = -1724.4 + 130.1 WK - 294.4 SM.FSmoker$. 

Let us try to estimate the birthweight of a baby born after 38 weeks of pregnancy to a mother who smokes. In this case $WK = 38$ and $SM.F = 1$ and the equation becomes $BW = -1724.4 + 130.1 \times 38 - 294.4 \times 1 = 2925$. 

In contrast, let us estimate the birthweight of a baby born after 38 weeks of pregnancy, but this time,t he mother is a non-smoker. In this case $WK = 38$ and $SM.F = 0$. The resulting equation is $BW = -1724.4 + 130.1 \times 38 - 294.4 \times 0 = 3219.4$,.

If we hold the length of pregnancy constant, what is the difference between the birthweight of a baby born to a mother who smokes versus a mother who does not smoke? $2925 - 3219.4 = -294.4$. This is the estimate of the slope.

Thus, the interpretation of the slope estimate for the variable `SM.F` proceeds by two stages. First we have to ask what the *reference category* is. In R, the reference category is the level of the dummy variable that is omitted from the estimates. In the present case, R provides estimates for smokers, but omits non-smokers. Thus, the reference category is "non-smokers".

Once we know the reference category, then we can interpret the estimate. The above results show that women who smoke have babies that weigh 294.4 grams less than women who are non-smokers, after adjusting for the length of gestation.

We can visualise the relationship between the two smoking categories as follows

```{r}
with(NCREG2, plot(WK, BW, col = SM.F,
                  ylab = "Birth Weight (grams)",
                  xlab = "Length of Gestation (weeks)", 
                  main = "Random Sample of Births from the North Carolina Birth Registry"))
legend("bottomright", legend=c("Non-smoker","Smoker"), 
       lty=c(1,1,1), lwd=2, cex=1, col=c("black","red"))
lines(NCREG2$WK[NCREG2$SM.F=="Non-smoker"],
      fitted(NCREG2.LM1)[NCREG2$SM.F=="Non-smoker"], 
      lwd=2, col="black")
lines(NCREG2$WK[NCREG2$SM.F=="Smoker"],
      fitted(NCREG2.LM1)[NCREG2$SM.F=="Smoker"], 
      lwd=2, col="red")
```

IMPORTANT: There are other types of coding schemes we can use instead of dummy variable coding. These are beyond the scope of this discussion, however.
